    <p>

        This maple bacon recipe will have everyone saying something never heard before... "More brussels sprouts please!" 
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 slices of thick-cut bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>2 lbs. Brussels Sprouts (rinsed and halved)</li>
        <li>1 tsp. Salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Maple Syrup</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high for 6-8 minutes or until crispy. 
            Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon and let cool and drain/dry.</li>
        <li>Add the brussels sprouts to the skillet, stirring well to coat them with the bacon grease. 
            Reduce heat to medium and let cook for 6 minutes or until sprouts start to brown/caramelize.</li>
        <li>Stir in the salt and continue to cook for an additional 6-8 minutes or until sprouts are just tender.
            Add water to steam and soften the brussels sprouts if needed.</li>
        <li>Stir in the maple syrup. Cook 3 minutes, stirring to coat. Add the cooked bacon and stir to combine.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We prefer to use a griddle to cook bacon since we know it has even heating and the bacon can lay flat.</li>
    </ul>
