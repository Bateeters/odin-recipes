    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
         A carbo-loaded vegetarian mac and cheese recipe. This is a perfect way to 
         sneak some veggies onto a picky eater's plate. And we don't even miss the mac!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 heads of cauliflower (~5 lbs), cored and broken into florets</li>
        <li>1 cup of sour cream</li>
        <li>2 cups of cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. While you're waiting 
            on that to boil, rinse and chop the cauliflower into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Add the cauliflower and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and return it to the pot over low heat.</li>
        <li>Add both the sour cream and cheddar, stir it in until cheddar has melted.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste (other seasonings are optional).</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from heat and plate servings. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with soup or salad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Greek yogurt can be substituted for the sour cream if desired.</li>
        <li>Try to use block cheese instead of shredded as it has a powder coating to prevent it from melting.</li>
        <li>Cheddar can be substituted for any kind of cheese you prefer.</li>
    </ul>
